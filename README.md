_A little about me..._

Newbie to technological careers... 2020 was a year of ✨_change_✨ and so I embarked on a quest to learn more about programming and various things related to this world. Proud to say I have learned enough to move into the IT world, and have quite the fondness and interest for databases in particular. 👀📊

_Things I'm working on & fun facts..._

* ✌🏽 **Pronouns:** _She_/_Her_ 👧🏻 though _They_ is also acceptable and will suffice.
* 🌱 **Focused On:** Learning MSQL & Oracle! Also don't database symbols remind you of a stack of 🥞...? 🤤
* 🗾 **Extra:** I'm also working on learning Japanese... and hope to one day visit Japan! 💕
- 🎊 **Hobbies:** I love cooking 🍝, enjoy playing video games 🎮, and I'm also into gardening 👩🏻‍🌾!
